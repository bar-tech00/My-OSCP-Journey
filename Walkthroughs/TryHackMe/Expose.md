# Expose

In this note I will present how I have completed Expose room on TryHackMe.

Firstly, I started by scanning the host with nmap. Right away I scanned every port on the victim machine by using -p- option which will give me overall information about services running on the victim machine across all ports. If this option wouldâ€™t be used then nmap would scan the top 1000 TCP ports.
```
nmap -p- 10.10.113.128
```
`-p-` - will scan all TCP ports

I have discovered 5 opened ports. I will focus on them by specifying them in my next nmap command. Also, I will add two other options -sV and -sC.
```
nmap -p 21,22,53,1337,1883 -sV -sC 10.10.113.128
```

`-p` - \<port1\>,\<port2\>,\<port n\> - will specify which port or ports we want to specify durning the scan

`-sV` - Probe open ports to determine service/version info

`-sC` - Performs a script scan using the default set of scripts. It is equivalent to --script=default. Some of the scripts in this category are considered intrusive and should not be run against a target network without permission.
