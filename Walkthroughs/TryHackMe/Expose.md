# Expose

In this note I will present how I have completed Expose room on TryHackMe.

Firstly, I started by scanning the host with nmap. Right away I scanned every port on the victim machine by using -p- option which will give me overall information about services running on the victim machine across all ports. If this option wouldâ€™t be used then nmap would scan the top 1000 TCP ports.
```
nmap -p- 10.10.113.128
```
