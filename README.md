# OSCP Preparation Knowledge Hub 📚🎯

This repository is my personal library of knowledge, created as I prepare for the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification. It serves as a structured collection of notes, walkthroughs, and insights from my learning journey.


## Purpose 🎯

This repository is primarily for me to organize and document my learning process. If you find it useful, feel free to explore, fork, or use any part of it for your own preparation.


## What's Inside 🛠️
* Notes & Concepts: Key information and commands I've learned along the way.
* TryHackMe Walkthroughs: Step-by-step solutions for challenges that helped build my skills.
* Future Content: I plan to add walkthroughs from other platforms like Hack The Box and Proving Grounds.


## Note ⚠️

While I strive to provide accurate and helpful content, remember that this is a personal knowledge base. Always practice ethical hacking responsibly and only on systems you have explicit permission to test.


Happy learning and hacking! 🐙💻
